# Sea-Listings

## Problem Statement

Craigslist has been around the web since 1995. Even though it's one of the most popular marketplace sites for users to peruse for various items, Craigslist's interface has not changed much. The front page interface appears outdated and lacks any visuals besides the user-generated images on listings. This web app hopes to provide images associated with the listings immediately after the user searches for a particular item. In particular, this app will be scraping listings from the Seattle Craiglist site.
